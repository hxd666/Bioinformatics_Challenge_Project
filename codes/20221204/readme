pipelines to  conduct the association test
two arguments are required:
1. subject (the subject we used in the association test: all, cases, age)
2. predictors (the predictors we used in the association test: H1B1G1, H1B1G2, H1_dosage, H1_beta_dosage, etc)

Effect size in the interaction is for interaction term; effect size in other models is for predictor term

If subject == 'all':
	Model 1: pheno ~ predictor + age + PCs
	Model 2: pheno ~ predictor + age + duration + PCs (in football players only)
	Model 3: pheno ~ predictor + age + duration + predictor * duration + PCs (in football players only)

If subject == 'cases':
	Model 1: pheno ~ predictor + age + PCs (in CTE cases only)
        Model 2: pheno ~ predictor + age + duration + PCs (in CTE cases & football players only)
        Model 3: pheno ~ predictor + age + duration + predictor * duration + PCs (in CTE cases & football players only)

If subject == 'age':
	# each model was tested in older group (age > median_age) and younger group (age <= median_age) separately except for model 4
	Model 1: pheno ~ predictor + age + PCs 
	Model 2: pheno ~ predictor + age + duration + PCs (in football players only) 
	Model 3: pheno ~ predictor + age + duration + predictor*duration + PCs (in football players only)
	Model 4: pheno ~ predictor + age_strata + predictor*age_strata + PCs
